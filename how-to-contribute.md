# ATO RESTful API Guidelines
The [ATO RESTful API Guidelines](Guidelines.md), as a design principle, encourages application developers to have 
resources accessible to them via a RESTful HTTP interface. To provide the smoothest possible experience for developers 
on platforms following the ATO RESTful API Guidelines, REST APIs SHOULD follow consistent design guidelines to make 
using them easy and intuitive.
